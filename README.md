Backup the Database
===================

The purpose of this script is to backup and optionally `--sanitize` the database
of your Backdrop CMS website.

Requirements
------------

* Linux server
* Backdrop CMS website
* PHP CLI

Installation and Configuration
-------------------------------

Clone this directory down to your filesystem. Perhaps to your home directory.
  * `git clone git@github.com:serundeputy/sql-dump-sanitize.git`
  * `cd sql-dump-sanitize`

Copy the `config.ini.example` file to `config.ini`
  * `cp config.ini.exaple config.ini`
  * Set the config variables in `config.ini` to values appropriate for your
  server and Backdrop database.

  * Required configuration variables. Copy the config.ini.example file to
  config.ini and replace with values for your server.

  ```php
  ; This user must have access to create and drop databases to use `--sanitize`
  DB_USER = root
  ; Password of the above user
  DB_PASSWORD = pass
  ; Database to perform backups and optional `--sanitize`
  DB_NAME = backdrop
  ; Temporary database to use when sanitizing. It will be created automatically.
  DB_TEMP = temp
  ; Host of the Database usually localhost, but could be an external name or IP
  DB_HOST = localhost
  ; Root directory of the Backdrop installation
  BACKDROP_ROOT = /var/www/html
  ; Directory where you would like the backups to be stored
  BACKUP_DESTINATION = /home/user/me/backups
  ```

Usage
-----

#### One time use Database Backups
* `php path/to/sql-dump-sanitize.php`
  * This will create a backup of the database written to the
  `BACKUP_DESTINATION` specified in `config.ini`.
* Options
  * `--quiet` (`-q` alias) suppress standard output (good for running as cron
    job)
  * `--sanitize` (`-s` alias) sanitize user email addresses for the backup.
  Sanitized backups are placed in `BACKUP_DESTINATION`/sanitized subdirectory.
  * `--rollover` (`-r` alias) remove stale backups where stale is defined by the
  `NUM_KEEP` config variable.
  * `--latest` (`-l` alias) provide a symlink to the latest backup named `DB_NAME-latest.sql.gz`.

#### One time use files directory Backups
* `php path/to/files-backup.php`
  * This will create a backup of the files directory written to the
  `BACKKUP_DESTINATION/files_backups` specified in `config.ini`
* Options
  * `--rollover_files` (`rf` alias) remove stale files dierectory backups where
  stale is defined by the `NUM_KEEP` config variable.

#### To run periodically on cron.
* Set a server cron task to run the script on a schedule (daily, weekly, monthly
or any and/or combination). For example a weekly on 8.05am Saturday morning; the
cron job would look like this:

```bash
# 1. Entry: Minute when the process will be started [0-60]
# 2. Entry: Hour when the process will be started [0-23]
# 3. Entry: Day of the month when the process will be started [1-28/29/30/31]
# 4. Entry: Month of the year when the process will be started [1-12]
# 5. Entry: Weekday when the process will be started [0-6] [0 is Sunday]

# Database backup #
###################
5 8 * * 6 {/absolute/path/to/php} {/path/to/script/}sql-dump-sanitize.php --quiet

# files directory backup #
##########################
5 10 * * 6 {/absolute/path/to/php} {/path/to/script/}files-backup.php --rollover_files
```

#### Deployments and master branch

BackdropCMS.org is using this to backup the b.org, f.b.org, and api.b.org databases and files.

* When pushing to the `master` branch these changes are automatically pulled to the server on system cron
* As a result make sure you test your things in a branch before pushing or merging to `master`

Happy backups ;)
